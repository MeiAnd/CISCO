###👋 Hello, I'm "Cryptic" — Cybersecurity Professional

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a keen interest in network security, threat analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Currently, I am expanding my skill set through the **Cisco Networking Academy’s Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Path**, where I've had the opportunity to dive deep into real-world labs, hands-on scenarios, and critical security concepts.

🚀 Labs & Projects
This repository showcases labs and projects I’ve completed as part of the Junior Cybersecurity Analyst Path, covering:

*  Fundamentals: Basic principles of IP addressing, subnetting, and network protocols.
*  Security Concepts: Hands-on with firewalls, access control, and the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* Threat Detection & Analysis: Identifying, analyzing, and mitigating threats using tools such as Wireshark, packet sniffers, and threat intelligence platforms.
* Incident Response: Learning the processes for handling security incidents, including triage, investigation, and mitigation steps.
* **EndPoint Security**: Techniques in digital forensics to identify root causes of network incidents.

Each project reflects my dedication to mastering cybersecurity concepts, and I’m constantly updating my skills with new technologies and best practices.
